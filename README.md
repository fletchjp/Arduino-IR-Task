# Arduino-IR-Task

 Examples codes for IR detection using TCRT 5000 detectors and various options for Task Scheduling.

## Introduction

These codes were put together to explore the best way to use the TCRT 5000 detectors.
Example use is illustrated on the Arduino Hardware page on the Knowledgebase.

I then extended the codes as a test for several alternative libraries for task scheduling.

The task scheduling codes are based on one of two libraries, IO_Abstraction and FreeRTOS. Information on these is available from the link above.

## No scheduling

There are two examples, one of which has an added LED to show the result of the input.

## IO_Abstraction

There are two examples.

## FreeRTOS

There is one example. I have focussed on IO_Abstraction for further work and not developed this example.
